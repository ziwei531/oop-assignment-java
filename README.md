## Summary
This project consists of four classes and methods:

-   Main.java: The main class that runs the program and calls other classes
-   UserLogin.java: The class that handles user login and registration
-   Menu.java: The class that displays the main menu and submenus for different functions
-   Product.java: The class that stores product information and methods for adding, deleting and updating products

### Written by teammates: 

 - The alert system uses a loop to check the stock level and expiry date
   of each product and prints a message if they are below a certain
   threshold.
 - The display product feature uses an array list to store all products
   and allows users to view them by using a switch case statement to
   filter by category.
 - The discount features use if-else statements to apply different
   discounts based on product type or quantity purchased.
